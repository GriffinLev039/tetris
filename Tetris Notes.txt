Tetris Notes

10 wide, 24 tall

each tile should be 15px by 15px
goal atm is just to create grid

scale to fill easily and readably is 

for every 1/400 there should be (960/400) * ( 1/960)

Each tetris tile

Red = "rgba(0,0,0,0.5)"
Blue = "rgba(0,0,0,0.5)"
Green = "rgba(0,0,0,0.5)"
Yellow = "rgba(0,0,0,0.5)"


Order code runs in:
1. Check if new piece is necessary
2. Create new piece
3. Apply new piece to board
4. Render new piece
5. Tick
6. Check collision
7. Repeat


To-Do:
1. Create functional Alpha
    - Self-timing Tick
    - Move left/right - Done
    - Rotation - mostly done
    - Collision between shapes - Done
    - Different colors between shapes
        > Use different numbers (1-7) to represent color, with 0 being blank
2. Ensure proper cycle of pieces (track which ones have been used)\
3. Create line removal
4. Create scoring system

xPos and yPos tracks the top left corner


Ordered current To-Do:
1. Different colors for pieces (easy)
2. Rotation
    a. Figure out method - store matrix of each rotation, rewrite dict and related code
3. Create timed tick
4. Create line removal
